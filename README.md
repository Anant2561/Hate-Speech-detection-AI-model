Project Title: Hate Speech Detection
Project Description
Hate speech detection is a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to automatically identify and classify harmful content in text data. This project will focus on developing a machine learning-based model that can accurately detect hate speech from social media posts, forums, and other online platforms. The model will leverage deep learning techniques like transformers (BERT, RoBERTa) and traditional NLP methods to enhance classification accuracy.

• Dataset Source: Kaggle (Hate Speech Dataset)
• Additional Sources: Research papers, GitHub repositories, and online forums discussing NLP-based hate speech detection models.
Technical Overview

This hate speech detection project employs a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to classify text into categories such as Hate Speech, Offensive Language, and Neutral Speech. 

 Key Components:
1. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: 
   - Removes URLs, mentions, and special characters.
   - Tokenizes text and applies stemming using the Porter Stemmer.
   - Extracts Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to understand sentence structure.
